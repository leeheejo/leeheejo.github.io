코드리뷰 관련 강연을 듣다가 지켜야할 수칙(?) 중에 `코드 컨벤션`이라는 단어가 나왔는데 무슨 뜻인지 몰라서 내용을 찾아봄. 

`convention : 관습, 관례`


**Coding conventions are a set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that language.** 

These conventions usually cover file organization, indentation, comments, declarations, statements, white space, naming conventions, programming practices, programming principles, programming rules of thumb, architectural best practices, etc. 

These are guidelines for software structural quality. 

**Software programmers are highly recommended to follow these guidelines to help improve the readability of their source code and make software maintenance easier.**

Coding conventions are only applicable to the human maintainers and peer reviewers of a software project. 

Conventions may be formalized in a documented set of rules that an entire team or company follows[1], or may be as informal as the habitual coding practices of an individual. 

Coding conventions are not enforced by compilers.


-> 정리하자면, `코드컨벤션`은 프로그래밍 표준(가이드라인)으로서 이를 준수하며 코드를 작성해 코드의 가독성을 향상시키고 유지보수를 용이하게 한다.
